# Copula-based trivariate spatial modelling of childhood illnesses in Western African countries
Acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, and fever are three common childhood illnesses, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigates the marginal and pairwise correlated effects of these diseases across Western African countries in a single analytical framework. Using data from nationally representative cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys, the study analyzed specific and correlated effects of each pair of childhood morbidity from ARI, diarrhea, and fever using copula regression models in fourteen contiguous Western African countries. Data concerning childhood demographic and socio-economic conditions were used as covariates. In this cross-sectional analysis of 152,125 children aged 0–59 months, the prevalence of ARI was 6.9%, diarrhea, 13.8%, and fever 19.6%. The results showed a positive correlation and geographical variation in the prevalence of the three illnesses across the study region. The estimated correlation and 95% confidence interval between diarrhea and fever is 0.431(0.300,0.539); diarrhea and ARI is 0.270(0.096,0.422); and fever and ARI is 0.502(0.350,0.614). The marginal and correlated spatial random effects reveal within-country spatial dependence. Source of water and access to electricity was significantly associated with any of the three illnesses, while television, birth order, and gender were associated with diarrhea or fever. The place of residence and access to newspapers were associated with fever or ARI. There was an increased likelihood of childhood ARI, diarrhea, and fever, which peaked at about ten months but decreased substantially thereafter. Mother’s age was associated with a reduced likelihood of the three illnesses. The maps generated could be resourceful for area-specific policy-making to speed up mitigation processes.
