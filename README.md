# Copula-based trivariate spatial modelling of childhood illnesses in Western African countries
Acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, and fever are three common childhood illnesses, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigates the marginal and pairwise correlated effects of these diseases across Western African countries in a single analytical framework. The study analyzed specific and correlated effects of each pair of childhood morbidity from ARI, diarrhea, and fever using copula regression models in fourteen contiguous Western African countries. The maps generated could be resourceful for area-specific policy-making to speed up mitigation processes. 

Estimation was based on the GJRM R package, and this repository contains example code used for the analysis.
